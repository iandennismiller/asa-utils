== Windows Quick Start ==

1. If necessary, download most recent version of Python 2.6, and double-click 
to install it.

As of August 24, 2010 the latest version of Python 2.6 is 2.6.6:

If a newer version of Python 2.6.x is available, be sure to download that.
Do not get 2.7.x, because that's a different story entirely.

2. Download the latest version of the .ZIP archive containing asa-utils, and 
double-click to extract it.
